## Sehtie's setup 🛠️

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies in the `frontend` directory.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Run the `frontend`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

5. Navigate to the `backend` directory.

6. Run the `backend`.

```bash
cd backend
dotnet run
```

7. The database will be created on Microsoft SQL Server, so make sure you have it installed and running.

## Running the database on macOS with Apple silicon 🍎

#### You can't run the database directly on your machine because Microsoft SQL Server doesn't support Apple Silicon. You can use Docker to run the database.

8. To run the database on macOS, you can use Docker.

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=DB_Password' -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```

#### if you are facing a problem running the image on docker you need to enable `Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon` from the docker preferences -> General.

9. Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost,1433;Database=master;User=sa;Password=DB_Password;"
}
```

10. Run the backend again.

```bash
dotnet run
```

11. The database will be created on Microsoft SQL Server running on Docker.
